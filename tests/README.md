# Tests

Unit tests for the browseragent package.

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run keyboard utils test
pnpm exec tsx tests/utils/keyboard.test.ts
```

## Test Structure

- `utils/` - Tests for utility functions (keyboard handling, validators, etc.)
- More test categories will be added as the test suite grows

## Adding New Tests

Create test files with the `.test.ts` extension and run them using `tsx`:

```bash
pnpm exec tsx tests/path/to/your.test.ts
```
